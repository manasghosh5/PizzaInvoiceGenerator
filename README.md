# PizzaInvoiceGenerator

This Java project is a simple application designed to generate bills for different types of pizzas. The project structure consists of three main components: the main class where the application is executed, a Pizza class which encapsulates the basic pizza pricing details, and a DeluxePizza class which extends the Pizza class to include additional pricing for deluxe pizzas.
